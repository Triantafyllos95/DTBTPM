	<h4>Why we need to protect our data</h4>
	<img src="shield.png" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
	<p>As you have seen in our case study video, the amount of information stored about us is increasing. While this can be useful, it is important that rules which regulate the storing, processing and disposing of this information exist. Databases are easily accessed, searched and edited. It’s also far easier to cross reference information stored in two or more databases than if the records were paper-based.</p> 

	<p>Can you imagine what could happen to our data if it was in the wrong hands? Think about how much information you store about yourself online: your name, age, employer address. These details deserve to be secure, and that's exactly why the data protection act is in place, to protect us, as well as our data.</p>

	<p>From watching the video, there are some questions we may want to ask:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Who has access to my personal information?</li>
		<li>How accurate is it?</li>
		<li>Can it be easily copied?</li>
		<li>Do you have to have the individual’s knowledge or permission to store information about him?</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>The Data Protection Act and how it works</h4>
	<img src="key.png" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
	<p>These extra capabilities and dangers offered by technology lead to the Data Protection Act being established in 1998. The Act recognises privacy as a basic human right and helps prevent information being misused or getting into the wrong hands. It requires annual notification by data controllers to ‘Information Commissioner’.</p>

	<p>Other European Union countries have passed similar laws as often information is held in more than one country.</p>

	<h4>Eight Principles of Data Protection:</h4>
	<h5>Data must be:</h5>
	<ol>
		<li>Fairly and lawfully processed.</li>
		<li>Processed for limited purposes.</li>
		<li>Adequate, relevant and not excessive.</li>
		<li>Accurate.</li>
		<li>Not kept for longer than necessary.</li>
		<li>Processed in line with the data subject’s rights.</li>
		<li>Secure.</li>
		<li>Not transferred to countries without adequate data protection.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The Data Protection works by having strict rules that individuals/companies have to follow to keep data secure. The information commissioner enforces the rules and in turn the data that we provide with our banks, employers etc. is safely kept within the Act regulations. Giving us the relief of knowing our data is kept safely and we can enjoy the services that providing our data give us!</p>

	<h4>There are two types of data:</h4>

	<h5>Personal Data</h5>

	<ol>
		<li>Name.</li>
		<li>Address.</li>
		<li>Bank details.</li>
	</ol>

	<h5>Sensitive Data</h5>

	<ol>
		<li>Racial or ethnic origin.</li>
		<li>Political opinions</li>
		<li>Religion</li>
	</ol>

	<h4>It keeps your data safe, now you keep other's data safe too!</h4>
	<img src="lock.png" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
	<p>Personal data like bank details <i>must</i> be secure for obvious reasons and information like this is vital to our daily lives. No one wants their identity stolen along with all their money!</p>

	<p>Sensitive data can easily break the rules of the Act as they may well be excessive in nature. If you're ever collecting information for a project or your own business, remember that you should only collect the information you need. An online shop wouldn't need to know your sexual preferences, would they?</p>
