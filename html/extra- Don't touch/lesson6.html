	<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to lesson 6 - How law impacts on Computer Scientists</h1>

<p>As young computer scientists there are a variety of laws that need to be considered. In everyday working there are certain laws that have a big influence on how a computer scientist will need to approach problems and situations, and how their mentality must be in tune with the laws that guide their profession.</p>

<h4>Data Protection Act</h4>
<img src="defensive.jpg" align ="right" id = "contentimageright">
<p>The first law that young computer scientists should be aware of is the Data Protection Act (explained in <a href="lesson3.html">lesson 3</a>). The Data Protection Act highlights a programmer's responsibility to ensure that data is made safe and secure within an organisation or any programs that access it. This affects a computer scientist as it emphasises the need for a <b>defensive</b> style of programming. Defensive programming is where the programmer anticipates errors or possible program breakages and codes functions to deal with any of these anticipated problems. To the left, is a truly defensive programmer at work.</p>

<p>This normally means issues such as expecting the user to enter 42 when asked “Enter your name” or not filling in any of the fields in a form.</p>

<p>With respect to the Data Protection Act however this means assuming that people will try and gain access to the data you are using and storing. No matter how strong and robust a program is deemed to be it will inevitably have a vulnerability that hackers can exploit. Look at the recent examples of <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/12/13/timeline-sony-breach-
data-leaks-far/">The Sony Pictures hacking</a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/13/third-party-snapchat-site-claims-says-pics-were-hacked-from-server">the Snapchat leaking of pictures </a> to see how important a robust system is, and also how even supposedly robust systems, such as Snapchats system which is not supposed to save any photos sent, can be hacked and data can be stolen.</p>

(CAPTION “A true defensive programmer”) sorry i don’t know the html to do it xD Your css is a 

mystery to me!-->

<p>To counter this threat a computer scientist must adapt the approach of assuming the worst will go wrong. By doing this many of threats the sensitive data will be exposed to, will be anticipated and thwarted. By keeping this law in mind, a computer scientist can avoid any potential disasters and ensure the data they are handling is kept secure.</p>

<h4>Copyrights, Designs and Patents Act</h4>

<p>After the Data Protection Act the next law that will affect any budding computer scientists is the Copyrights, Designs and Patents Act (explained in <a href="lesson4.html">lesson 4</a>). 

This Act will have less of an affect on the programming style of new computer scientists, but will require them to be more aware of where their resources come from and how they use them</p>

<img src="swag.jpg" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
<p>A computer scientist needs to ensure that all of the resources they use are either copyright free or have explicit permission from the copyright holder for their use. Otherwise the copyright holder may decide to sue the organisation or individual responsible. This is a very common situation regarding copyright. </p>

<p>To understand it better, imagine you have designed a piece of software. This piece of software required several weeks of nonstop work to create and is something you are extremely proud of. You upload this software online to your personal to allow people to use it and to get feedback on how it runs.


 Several weeks later you hear from a friend that a program that they downloaded from another site seems to be eerily similar to the program you created. You check out this program and find out that it is in fact, more or less, the program that you had uploaded to your site.</p>

<p>In this scenario you would feel angry, cheated, annoyed and above all disappointed that someone else had the lack of respect to ask you to use your program and stole your weeks of hard work for their own personal gain. By reflecting upon these emotions you can see why it is important to make sure you never use someone elses material (whether that be pictures, videos, code or anything else) as you would never want to be in this situation yourself. You 
must respect other professionals and the work they have done and ensure you never use other peoples work without permission. Otherwise, there’s nothing stopping them doing the same thing to you.</P>

(CAPTION “Ask before using anyone else’s property”)-->

<h4>Freedom Of Information Act</h4>

<p>The final Act that will affect young computer scientists is the Freedom of Information Act(explained in <a href="lesson5.html">lesson 5</a>). This act affects computer scientists in a very small way, but enough for it to affect development practices. The Freedom of Information Act allows for any individual from around the world to request data from a public institution in Britain. The organisation that receives the request must supply the information by law, and respond within 20 days to the request. The request is normally free, but if the cost of retrieving the data costs more than £100, 10% of the cost of retrieving the data will be passed on to the person who submitted the request.</p>

<p>To save time and money, the data requested must be easily accessible, and this can be achieved by developing an efficient database system, or data management system. This requires the programmer to consider the ease of use of the program he creates and also the efficiency of it, to ensure that any given request can be handled quickly and with the least expense to the organisation. This only has a marginal affect on a programmer but it does encourage good programming practices such as making the program as simple to use as possible, emphasising program efficiency and properly documenting programs. </p>
