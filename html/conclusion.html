	<h4>Piracy, a violation of copyright</h4>

	<iframe align="right" id = "contentimageright" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EnLVyNB52R8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>The term "Piracy" is often associated with the act of violating copyright, such as illegally obtaining (Most often through downloading) software in which the individual did not purchase for covered under fair use. One can get benefit of that Illegal material downloaded and gain profit as well as share it without any exchange.</p>

	<p>Thus, due to the different ways that one can manipulate this illegal piece of software, piracy is divided into 5 categories:</p>
	
	<h5>Counterfeiting:</h5>

	<p>Into this category belong the illegal copies of all products.Mostly software programs that are duplicated and sold for the benefit of third party users.This type of piracy is very common nowadays as many graphical operating systems such as microsoft windows are being copied and sold illegaly, leading the profit of the company into a halt.</p>

	<h5>End-user Piracy:</h5>

	<p>In this section belong individuals that produce copies of programs that they are not authorised to use. These include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Using licensed copy to install a program on multiple computers</li>
		<li>Copying discs for installation.</li>
		<li>Taking advantage of upgrade offers without having a legal copy of the version to be upgraded.</li>
	</ul>
	
<img src="burglar.jpg" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
	<h5>Internet Piracy:</h5>

	<p>As you can guess, this category is referring to users that download software from the Internet. This is a very difficult section for one to understand as it is only referring to software that is downloaded from the web and not just the copy of a software like Counterfeiting. However, the action afterwards(e.g. the modification and duplication of the file) belongs to the Counterfeiting section.</p>

	<p>In the internet Piracy section there are 3 sub-sections that also belong to Internet Piracy:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Webpages that make software available for download without any kind of exchange.</li>
		<li>Auction websites that offer counterfeit or out of channel software.</li>
		<li>PTP(Peer-to-peer) networks that allow unauthorized transfer of copyrighted software</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Client-Server Overuse:</h5>

	<p>Client Server Overuse (also known as CSO) is when people from a newtwork are making use of an illegal copy of a program at the same time. For example, many programs several years ago came up with the idea of the license key.The idea behind that was that one user would have the key only if they had bought the program. However, people started to share these “hidden” keys and so everyone could have the program running but with someone else’s license key.</p>

	<h5>Hard-Disk Loading:</h5>

	<p>This category is referring to companies that install illegally copyrighted operating system or software into Hard disks so they can sell the particular computer in a way that it will be more attractive to the public.This can category can be very tricky as one can be confused with End-User Piracy as the operating system or software used is not meant to be used from more than one individual, however Hard-Disk Loading is referring to people who make profit through this way.</p>

	<p>This occurs when a business sells new computers with illegal copies of software loaded onto the hard disks to make the purchase of the machines more attractive.</p>

	<h4>The Pirate Bay</h4>
	<iframe align="right" id ="contentimageright" width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t7d0V4l8068" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	<p>One example that belongs to most of the above categories is “The Pirate Bay”. “The Pirate Bay” is a website that provides torrents to millions of users as it is the most visited torrent website in the whole World Wide Web. In 2009, the founders of the website were found guilty of assisting in making copyright content freely available and thus fined $3.5 million. Websites like this make it much easier to violate intellectual property and copyright laws and in today's society it's not seen as bad as stealing physical objects, even though it's practically the same thing! See the video to the right for a bit more on IP.</p>

	<p>After a few years, on the tenth of December, Svartholm Warg, one of the site's original founders, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for hacking and copyright infringement, bringing in that way the big Shutdown of the Pirate Bay.</p>

	<p>In the decade since PTP file-sharing site Napster and Pirate Bay emerged in 1999 and 2003 in order, music sales in the U.S. have dropped 47 percent, from $14.6 billion to $7.7 billion. From 2004 through 2009, approximately 30 billion songs were illegally downloaded on file-sharing networks. NPD reports that only 37 percent of music acquired by U.S. consumers in 2009 was paid for.In addition, Frontier Economics recently estimated that U.S. Internet users annually consume between $7 and $20 billion worth of digitally pirated recorded music.</p>

	<p>Moreover, in Britain piracy costs more than just money. Illegal downloading of films, games and music could mean the loss of 30,000 jobs in the UK, according to a powerful alliance of retailers and rights-holders.</p>
