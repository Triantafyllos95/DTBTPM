	<h4>What is the Freedom of Information Act?</h4>

	<p>The freedom of Information Act(also known as FOI) was proposed by the goverment of the UK in 1997.It was an action based on the fact that access to information would help the public to make public authorities accountable for their actions and allows public debate to be better informed and more productive. In addition access to official information can also improve the public confidence and trust if government and public sector bodies are seen as being open.</p>

	<p>The Act covers any recorded information that is held by a public authority in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and by UK-wide public authorities based in Scotland. Information held by Scottish public authorities is covered by Scotland’s own FOI Act 2002. Such authorities are government departments, local authorities, the NHS, state schools and police forces.</p>

	<p>Still, the Act does not necessarily refers to every single organisation that receives public money. For instance, it does not cover some charities that receive grants and certain private sector organisations that perform public functions.</p>

	<p>Such actions had good results as a survey in 2011 showed that 81% of the public agreed that FOI act increased their trust to many companies and organisations.</p>

	<p>The main idea behind FOI is that people have the right to know about the activities of public authorities, except if there is a very good reason for one organisation not to provide them. But apart from very unique exceptions, the above statement assumes that:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Every individual has the right to access official information. Therefore, information should be kept private only when there is a good reason and it is permitted by the Act.</li>
		<li>A person does not need to provide a reason for wanting the information. Nevertheless, the organisation must provide a reason for not providing such information.</li>
		<li>One must treat all requests for information equally, except under specific circumstances relating to vexatious requests and personal information.</li>
		<li>Consequently, one should treat all requesters equally, they should only disclose information under the Act if they would disclose it to anyone else who asked. In other words, one should consider any information released under the Act as if it were being released to the world at large.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Who can make a FoI request?</h4>

	<p>Anyone can make a freedom of information request.They don’t have to be UK citizens, or resident in the UK. Freedom of information requests can also be made by organisations,and not only by individuals. For example a newspaper, a campaign group, or a company etc. Employees of a public authority can make requests to their own employer, although good internal communications and staff relations will normally avoid the need for this.
	</p>

	<p>Requesters should direct their requests for information to the public authority they think will hold the information. The public authority that receives the request is responsible for responding. Requests should not be sent to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), except where the requester wants information the ICO holds.</p>

	<h4>What is more important?</h4>

	<p>The golden rule of the FOI act is that one can make information available to the public if they know they can access it, and what is available for them.</p>
