	<h4>Ethics</h4>
	<img  src="hierarchy.jpg" width="300" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
	<p>In discussion of laws, it is also important to mention ethics and importance of good ethical standards to computer scientists. Laws exist to enforce what is right and what is wrong, but our conscience has done that since our childhood and before we learnt what any of the laws mean. We all remember that annoying nagging feeling when we played a prank that might go one step too far. That determines our ethical standards of behaviour and influences all our life. </p>
	<p>Working in professional capacity, such as a computer scientist involves making a lot of decisions. This is where ethics come in. They are enforced by the conscience of the individual, as opposed to laws, being enforced by the power of governmental organisation. It is impossible to have laws govern every step a person takes and ‘grey areas’ are inevitable. </p>
	<p> The discussion here is about ethical decisions relative to working in the field of computing. The reason ethics are important in computing isn't the computers; it is the information stored in the computers and how much technology is integrated into our lives. Information is awfully intimate stuff. We work to generate it, buy it, sell it, and sometimes misuse it.  Equality, the extent to which technology in integrated in our society means that it has a lot of influence. Technology is used in education, space exploration medicine, just to mention a few. </p>
	<p>Computers and computer software are not the first, nor will they be the last, technologies to raise new moral concerns. They simply offer new possibilities and challenge the way things can be done. This also means that new possibilities are not always good and greater influence often translates to greater consequences.  </p>
	<p>Consequences caused by programmers can be even more severe. This was unfortunately the case with the Therac-25 accidents. Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine created by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). Its’ malfunction resulted in 6 accidents of radiation burns in the patients and sadly, several deaths. It is known that the software was created by one programmer whose qualifications for the job are questionable. </p>

	<p>Thus, being a computer scientist means being a professional. What does that imply? Let’s break it down. A ‘professional’ is defined as “Conforming to the standards of a profession and being part of a professional body”.  Professional bodies, in turn, are not-for-profit organisations that certify successful course completion of its members, and thereupon awards a license and bestows a recognized appellation (Chartered Accountant, Attorney at Law, Doctor of Medicine, etc.). They are essentially made up of professionals and exist in the interest of the profession, its members and the public interest. Professional bodies usually prescribe a discretionary or mandatory code of conduct for their members and can withdraw membership if a professional does not act in accordance with the code of conduct or no longer has all the membership requirements. </p>
	
	<h5>In summary, professionals are distinguished from the general public by:</h5>
	
	<ol>
		<li>A professional association</li>
		<li>A cognitive base</li>
		<li>Institutionalised training </li>
		<li>Licensing </li>
		<li>College ‘control’ </li>
		<li>A code of ethics </li>
	</ol>

	<p>Modern society is very complex. Being a professional does not mean being responsible for things outside your control, but it does require you to recognise areas where you do have influence and take responsibility for your decisions. To help their members in this and further the profession, professional bodies: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Establish a code of conduct (code of ethics) </li>
		<li>Disseminate knowledge via conferences and publications </li>
		<li>Advise government about relevant matters </li>
		<li>Set standards of education and experience for prospective members </li>
		<li>Most professional bodies will obtain a Royal Charter </li>
	</ol>
	 <img src="BCS.png" align ="right" width ="250" id = "contentimageright">
	<p>For computer scientists and software engineers, the professional body in question is the <strong> British Computer Society </strong> (known as BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT). It has the following ethical themes highlighted in its’ code of conduct: Public Interest, Professional Competence and Integrity, Duty to Relevant Authority and Duty to the Profession (British Computer Society, 2011). This report aims to explore various ethical issues that might be encountered by members of BCS, the guidance provided by the BCS code of conduct with respect to those issues and the consequences of actions professionals might take.  </p>
	<p>Other professional bodies include: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> IEEE - Institute of Electrical & Electronic Engineers </li>
		<li> ACM - Association for Computing Machinery </li>
		<li> ACS - Australian Computer Society </li>
		<li> IET - Institute of Engineering & Technology </li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>With so much talk about this mysterious code of ethics, let’s take a closer look at the British Computer Society code of conduct and its four sections.  </h5>
	<p>As a professional you must remember to act within <strong>‘The Public Interest’</strong>. Which means being aware of the affects your work has on society in general and conducting your activities to benefit society, rather than simply your employer or yourself… </p>
	<p>You shall: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>a. have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others and the environment. </li>
		<li>b. have due regard for the legitimate rights of Third Parties </li>
		<li>c. conduct your professional activities without discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, marital status, nationality, colour, race, ethnic origin, religion, age or disability, or of any other condition or requirement </li>
		<li>d. promote equal access to the benefits of IT and seek to promote the inclusion of all sectors in society wherever opportunities arise. </li>
	</ul>

	 <p>Acting with <strong>“Professional Competence and Integrity”</strong> is vital to prevent serious accidents. Everyone makes mistakes, but falsely claiming to being capable of carrying out certain work is incredibly unprofessional and could endanger the users of your system… </p>
	<p>You shall: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>a. only undertake to do work or provide a service that is within your professional competence.</li>
		<li>b. NOT claim any level of competence that you do not possess.</li>
		<li>c. develop your professional knowledge, skills and competence on a continuing basis, maintaining awareness of technological developments, procedures, and standards that are relevant to your field.</li>
		<li>d. ensure that you have the knowledge and understanding of Legislation  and that you comply with such Legislation, in carrying out your professional responsibilities.</li>
		<li>e. respect and value alternative viewpoints and, seek, accept and offer honest criticisms of work.</li>
		<li>f. avoid injuring others, their property, reputation, or employment by false or malicious or negligent action or inaction.</li>
		<li>g. reject and will not make any offer of bribery or unethical inducement.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<img  src="comic.gif" width="300" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
	<p>The <strong> “Duty to Relevant Authority” </strong> recognises that individuals are prone to acting in own selfish interest and forewarns that all professionals must hold the regulations and expectations of their relevant authority in high regard and under no circumstances made decisions for personal gain.. </p>
	<p>You shall:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>a. carry out your professional responsibilities with due care and diligence in accordance with the Relevant Authority’s requirements whilst exercising your professional judgement at all times.</li>
		<li>b. seek to avoid any situation that may give rise to a conflict of interest between you and your Relevant Authority.</li>
		<li>c. accept professional responsibility for your work and for the work of colleagues who are defined in a given context as working under your supervision.</li>
		<li>d. NOT disclose or authorise to be disclosed, or use for personal gain or to benefit a third party, confidential information except with the permission of your Relevant Authority, or as required by Legislation. </li>
		<li>e. NOT misrepresent or withhold information on the performance of products, systems or services (unless lawfully bound by a duty of confidentiality not to disclose such information), or take advantage of the lack of relevant knowledge or inexperience of others. </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In remembering your <strong>“Duty to the Profession”</strong>, you have to act with the integrity of a representative of your profession and follow the regulations applicable to you in that regard. </p>
	<p>You shall: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>a. accept your personal duty to uphold the reputation of the profession and not take any action which could bring the profession into disrepute. </li>
		<li>b. seek to improve professional standards through participation in their development, use and enforcement. </li>
		<li>c. uphold the reputation and good standing of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT. </li>
		<li>d. act with integrity and respect in your professional relationships with all members of BCS and with members of other professions with whom you work in a professional capacity. </li>
		<li>e. notify BCS if convicted of a criminal offence or upon becoming bankrupt or disqualified as a Company Director and in each case give details of the relevant jurisdiction. </li>
		<li>f. encourage and support fellow members in their professional development.  </li>
	</ul>
