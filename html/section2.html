	<h4>Project Discussion</h4>
	<p>The above video described the project called HealthCare.gov. HealthCare.gov is a health insuarance website founded by the US government. This websites allows the US residents from 36 states to get insured with private insurance companies and offer subsidies to the poor population of the country. This website is also offering assistance to the small companies. It was characterized as one of the greatest goverment founded websites.</p> 

	<p>After a couple of years of hard working, designing and testing, the website came to publicity on the 1st of October 2013, as scheduled. It made a bright appearance and as it was expected thousands of US citizens logged in the website almost immediatelly. Nonetheless, both the government and the public was shocked after finding out that a huge amount of time and money were wasted for a not so satisfying result. </p>

	<p>Questions about the topic:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>What went wrong?</li>
		<li>Why did it fail?</li>
		<li>Could these problems have been avoided?</li>
		<li>What is the conclusion?</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>What Went Wrong?</h4>
	<img src="../imgs/healthcare_gov1.jpg" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">
	<p>Eventhough the website seem to be up and running, visitors encountered a humongous number of technical problems.The results of these problems were that only 1% of the interested people achieved to register to the website successfully during the 1st week of its operation,yet more problems occured. Even registed individuals encountered further issues as insurance companies and providers reported that some application submitted online via the website were lacking of information.</p>

	<p>There was no doubt that this website it was a failed project which lead the government to waste millions of US dollars and time.Thankfully, it wasn't that long until the government found out that major mistakes had been made and decided to replace the CGI Group IT consulting company with Accenture which started working on the project on January 2014. </p>
	
	<p>After a numerous mistakes encountered, Accenture solved the problems and saved the situation as the website came back up again on the 15th of November 2014(Almost a year after its first appearance.</p>

	<h4>Why did it fail?</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Lack of Trainning.</li>
		<p>Bloomberg reported that the employees themselves were not completely trained for the specific job eventhough they were in charge of the government projects.<p>
		<li>Lack of Communication.</li>
		<p>The communication between departments was completely unexisted. For instance, 5 different employees oversaw a single contract over tge course of five years. However the individual responsible for the project was not always documented.<p>
		<li>Generally Lack of Project Management.</li>
		<p>The lack of communication and knowledge if combined with the decisions taken, lead to the conclusion that there was a huge lack of project management in that government project.</p>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Generally projects around the globe fail for numerous reasons. Most of these reasons depend on the difficulty, complexity and stability of the project. However, there are certain
	cases where certain actions can be avoided in order to achieve the project's goal.</p>

	<h4>Could these problems have been avoided?</h4>

	<h1>YES!</h1>
	
	<p>It is all based on how a team manages its projects.<br>
	When a project lacks of Project Management then the whole<br>
	team responsible for that project is literally hopeless.<br>
	Good Project Management can offer stability and standard ways<br>
	of communication between the team in order for each of the members<br>
	to understand the level and progress of the project.<br>
	There are some rules that could have been followed to helped <br>
	the project to succeed and thrive without having these catastrophic
	results. <br><br>
	Such rules are called "The Golden Rules of Project Management".</p>
	
	<h5>Golden Rules of Project Management.</h5>
	
	<ol>
		<li><b>Stakeholder Management.</b></li>
		<p>Analyze, plan and implement actions designed to understand and be trusted by your stakeholders.<br>
		Thing that was not applicable in our case as the people in charge were luck of information about<br>
		the whole project.</p>
		<li><b>Communication.</b></li>
		<p>Communication between the group itself and its stakeholders is the most important thing.<br>
		communicating with your team makes you understand their problems and keeps you aware of the<br>
		problems they encounter.<br>
		Communication was the first thing that was lacking from that project.</p>
		<li><b>Knowledge Management.</b></li>
		<p>Knowledge Management is the systematic management of information and learning. It makes your<br>
		personal problems to be shared with the rest of the people around you and help<br>
		you build experience on them.</p>
	</ol>

	<h4>What is the conclusion?</h4>
	<img src="../imgs/section2_conclusion.jpg" align ="center" id = "contentimageleft">
	<p><b>1)</b> A project in order to be successful needs to follow the golden rules of Project Management.!</p>

	<p><b>2)</b> All the above problems could have been avoided if a correct Project Management was applied by the<br>
	Project Managers.</p>
	
	<p><b>3)</b> Cutting the price of the management you offer will triple the chances of failure of your project.</p>
