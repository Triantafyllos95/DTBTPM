	<h4>Computer laws</h4>
	<img src="sciencestudent.jpg" align ="right" style="width:20em"id = "contentimageright">
	<p>The aspects of computer law are some of the the most important things that you as a computer scientist will come across in your studies and career. These laws are everywhere in our daily lives, when you download a movie or song, scroll through facebook, and when you scroll through the dreaded terms of agreement after every single download. These things are often overlooked, but the laws behind them are responsible for protecting our data, ideas and property!

	<br>
	<br>

	It would be your job as a student of computer science (and hopefully an employee within the field) to uphold the laws of computing throughout your career. You are the protectors of the laws of computer science!

	<br>
	<br>
	I'm going to ask you a few questions at the end of this introduction and we'll really see how much you know about computer laws. But don't worry if you don't score well, at the end of each lesson you'll have the chance to redeem yourself and test your knowledge after learning more.
	<br>
	<br>
	Whether you're working in digital forensics dealing with computer crime or working in an office writing software, computer law will affect you. Can you name any of the computer laws that you've heard of?
	</p>

	<p>Here's a few of them that will come up in the lessons:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The Data Protection Act</li>
		<li>Copyright Designs and Patents Act</li>
		<li>Freedom of Information Act</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These days, computer scientists and software engineers are way more vital to the world we live in than even 10 years ago, and because of this the laws have changed. Computers can do amazing things, but also really terrible things! That's why we have to be careful. Did you know that between 1985 and 1987, 6 people were given overdoses or radiation up to a thousand times their recommended dosage because of a design fault in a piece of software? Goes to show you how much power a computer holds and why there has to be strict laws about them!<p>

	<img src="crime.jpg" align ="left" id = "contentimageleft">

	<!--<div id = "fact">
	<h4>Did you know that between 1985 and 1987 6 people were given overdoses in radiation due to a design fault in a piece of software called Therac-25?</h4>
	</div>-->

	<p>So, like the picture on my left illustrates (maybe a bit extremely), computers can be dangerous! But that's why we have young students like you that can protect us in future.</p>

	<h4>Computer Ethics</h4>

	<p>Another important element of your career is computer ethics. Laws are enforced by the government but ethics should be enforced by you! Ethics are the rules that you should give yourself in order to be a professional and respectable individual. Have a look at the <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments_of_Computer_Ethics">ten commandments of computer ethics</a> and you can use them as a basis for your own code of ethics. </p>

	<p>Ethics are all about what's right and wrong:</p>

	<p>If you were a software developer, would you take care to think about the consequences of your newest project? What if you could do something really great but you just needed to borrow that one piece of software that you couldn't pay for? Is it okay to "borrow" it, I mean, those software companies probably make tons of money, right?</p>

	<p>"Borrowing" software like this is actually illegal, and it violates the <a href ="http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/conduct.pdf">BCS code of conduct</a>, a set of rules made by IT professionals. It's a pretty useful document that gives a good guide on how to behave in a working environment. You can sign up there as a student if you're interested too (for a link, go to the useful links section).</p>

	<p>What do you think you would you do in a situation like this? You may have an ethical dilemma like this at some point in your career so think about it! And if you're ready for the quiz: <a href = "lesson1quiz.html" id="quizstart">click here.</a></p>
