	<h4>What is cybercrime?</h4>

	<p>Cybercrime is a fast-growing crime area that more and more crimes are committed. Cybercime defines as “criminal offences committed against or with the help of computer networks.” This can be divided into several sections:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Hacking</li>
		<li>Virus Transmission</li>
		<li>Phishing</li>
		<li>Fraud and intellectual property infringement</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>CBI (Confederation of British Industry) Cybercime survey (2001)</h4>

	<p>The CBI research <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/CBI-warns-of-cybercrime">survey</a> in 2001 warns that cybercrime is seriously damaging the take-up of e-commerce in the UK. According to the survey made, the main threats companies were:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Viruses</li>
		<li>Hacking</li>
		<li>Illegal database access</li>
		<li>Intellectual property infringement</li>
	</ul>

	<p>What is more, it was found that companies were more concerned with viruses and public loss of trust than financial loss.</p>

	<h4>Convention on Cybercrime</h4>

	<p>Convention is the first international treaty seeking to address internet and computer crime by harmonizing national laws, improving investigate techniques. Convention deals with infringements of copyright, computer-related fraud, child pornography, hate crimes and violations of network security.</p>

	<p>The following offences are defined by the convention:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Illegal access</b> – This involves accessing by a malicious user or a malicious program having no right.</li>
		<li><b>Illegal interception</b> – Includes accessing database without right, seriously hindering the functioning of a computer system or transmitting, damaging, deleting, altering or suppressing computer data without right.</li>
		<li><b>Data interference</b> - The alteration, deletion or deterioration of computer data or restriction to such data without right is an offence.</li>
		<li><b>System interference</b> - This conduct involves the intentional hindering of a computer system, without a right of the function of the computer system, by inputting, transmitting, damaging, deleting, deteriorating, altering or suppressing computer data.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Sony Pictures Hack</h4>
	
	<p>In November 24, 2014 The <a href="http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/sony-hack-said-to-leak-47000-social-security-numbers-celebrity-data/">Sony Pictures Company was hacked</a> by “#GOP”. 100 Gigabytes of Data was allegedly stolen and is being released in batches on the web. Full-length copies of five unreleased Sony films were leaked including: "Annie," "Fury," "Still Alice," "Mr. Turner," and "To Write Love On Her Arms." What is more, 47,000 Social Security numbers and birth dates and HR employee performance reviews were stolen. All passport and visa information for both actors and crews working on Sony films.</p>

	<p>Think of the potential harm this could cause the people whose data was leaked. All of that personal and sensitive has been leaked to strangers and there is no knowing what could be done with it. As technology advances it is vital that cyber-crime units are funded and that we have them preventing incidents such as this.</p>

	<h4>Digital Evidence</h4>

	<iframe align="left" id = "contentimageleft" width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-YKGVL4FQ24" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>Digital Evidence - “any data stored or transmitted using a computer that supports or refutes a theoryon how an offence occurred or addresses critical elements of the offence such as intent or alibi” (Chisum, 1999).</p>

	<p>Digital Evidence is very important in nowadays life as more and more investigations are made in digital. There are plenty investigations that have to be examined, which is daunting task, but an increasingly common one in the fight against cybercrime.</p>

	<p>Digital Evidence can be replicated down to even byte. As opposed to a murder weapon, such as a firearm, digital evidence is replicated first and the analysis is performed on the copy as “best evidence” in the analysis is the copy of digital evidence. An examiner can make an exact copy of a computer’s hard drive, whereas a ballistics expert cannot make a duplicate firearm.</p>

	<h4>Challenges</h4>

	<p>Nowadays most digital crimes (hacking) requires investigations such as deriving from binary data is highly complex and usually littered with technical terms and concepts. Encryption (process of encoding messages) is a complex investigation to encrypt coded information.</p>

	<h4>Gathering digital evidence</h4>
	
	<p>Gathering digital evidence is very important process that has to be done. There are several steps that has to be taken into account:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make a digital image of each source.</li>
		<li>After seizure, but before examination:
			<ul>
		 <li>Make forensically sound copies of media.</li> 
		 <li>Produce image files on trusted workstation.</li>
			</uL>
		</li>
		<li>Copy of <i>all</i> data on the medium that must be indentical to the original.</li>
		<li>May involve use of specialist programs.</li>
	</ul>
